# swi-fmt

A tool for formatting [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) source files. 

The source for the formatter.pl (the most important part) was originally forked [from a file](https://github.com/arthwang/vsc-prolog/blob/master/out/src/features/formatter_swi.pl)
in arthwangs project [vsc-prolog](https://github.com/arthwang/vsc-prolog).

Still under construction, consider it a play thing for now.
